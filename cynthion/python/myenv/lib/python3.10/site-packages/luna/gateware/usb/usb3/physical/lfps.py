""" Low-frequency periodic signaling gateware.

LFPS is the first signaling to happen during the initialization of the USB3.0 link.

LFPS allows partners to exchange Out Of Band (OOB) controls/commands and consists of bursts where
a "slow" clock is generated (between 10M-50MHz) for a specific duration and with a specific repeat
period. After the burst, the transceiver is put in electrical idle mode (same electrical level on
P/N pairs while in nominal mode P/N pairs always have an opposite level):

Transceiver level/mode: _=0, -=1 x=electrical idle
|-_-_-_-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|-_-_-_-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|...
|<burst>                    |<burst>                    |...
|<-----repeat period------->|<-----repeat period------->|...

A LFPS pattern is identified by a burst duration and repeat period.

To be able generate and receive LFPS, a transceiver needs to be able put its TX in electrical idle
and to detect RX electrical idle.

    Attributes
    ----------
    low_speed_only: Signal(), input
        If set, the device will be forced to operate as a low-speed device.
    prevent_high_speed: Signal(), input
        If set, the device will be prohibited from entering high-speed states; and will thus
        act like it's a full speed device (low_speed_only = 0).
    bus_busy: Signal(), input
        Hold-off signal that indicates that driving the bus should be delayed.
    vbus_connected: Signal(), input
        Indicates that the device is connected to VBUS. When this is de-asserted, the device will
        be held in perpetual bus reset, and reset handshaking will be disabled.
    line_state: Signal(2), input
        The UTMI linestate signals; used to read the current state of the USB D+ and D- lines.
    disconnect: Signal(), input
        If set, the device will be switched into non-driving operating mode to force a host disconnect.

    bus_reset: Signal(), output
        Strobe; pulses high for one cycle when a bus reset is detected. This signal indicates that the
         device should return to unaddressed, unconfigured, and should not longer be in High Speed mode.
    suspended: Signal(), output
        Held high while the USB device should be in suspend. This technically indicates that the device should
        drop down to consuming suspend current (<= 2.5mA), but very few devices are compliant with this requirement.
        Either way, a polite device might reduce its power consumption while in suspend.

    current_speed: Signal(2), output
        A USBSpeed value that indicates the current operating speed. Used both to drive our device's
        knowledge of operating speed and to drive our PHY's speed selection.
    operating_mode: Signal(2), output
        The current UTMI operating mode. Used to select whether we're driving the USB bus directly;
        or whether we're letting the PHY handle NRZI/bit-stuffing.
    termination_select: Signal(), output, default=1
        Determines the bus termination mode. In LS/FS, this determines the presence of our presence-detect
        pull-up. In HS mode, this determines whether the USB high-speed termination is present (0), or
        whether we're in chirp mode (1).

    tx: UTMITransmitInterface, output stream
                     -- Our UTMI transmit interface; used to drive chirp signaling onto the bus.

class USBInTransferManager(Elaboratable):
    """ Sequencer that converts a long data stream (a USB *transfer*) into a burst of USB packets.

    This module is designed so it can serve as the core of a IN endpoint.

    Attributes
    ----------

    active: Signal(), input
        Held high to enable this module to send packets to the host, and interpret tokens from the host.
        This is typically equivalent to the relevant endpoint being addressed by the host.

    transfer_stream: StreamInterface, input stream
        Input stream; accepts transfer data to be sent on the endpoint. This stream represents
        a USB transfer, and can be as long as is desired; and will be sent in max-packet-size chunks.

        For this stream: ``first`` is ignored; and thus entirely optional. ``last`` is optional;
        if it is not provided; this module will send only max-length-packets, sending a new packet
        every time a full packet size is reached.
    packet_stream: USBInStreamInterface, output stream
        Output stream; broken into packets to be sent.

    flush: Signal(), input
        If high, data that is currently buffered will be sent out as soon as possible. The module will
        not wait further for the input stream to end, or to have a max-length packet; it will send a
        packet as soon as possible.

    discard: Signal(), input
        If high, data that is currently buffered will be discarded. The module will not buffer further
        data, or send any further packets, until this signal is low again.

    data_pid: Signal(2), output
        The LSBs of the data PID to be issued with the current packet. Used with :attr:`packet_stream`
        to indicate the PID of the transmitted packet.

    tokenizer: TokenDetectorInterface, input
        Connection to a detector that detects incoming tokens packets.

    handshakes_in: HandshakeExchangeInterface, input
        Indicates when handshakes are received from the host.
    handshakes_out: HandshakeExchangeInterface, output
        Output that carries handshake packet requests.

    generate_zlps: Signal(), input
        If high, zero-length packets will automatically be generated if the end of a transfer would
        not result in a short packet. (This should be set for control endpoints; and for any interface
        where transfer boundaries are significant.)

    start_with_data1: Signal(), input
        If high, the transmitter will start our PID with DATA1
    reset_sequence: Signal(), input
        If true, our PID generated will reset to the value indicated by `start_with_data1`.
        If desired, this can be held permanently high to control our PID expectation manually.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_packet_size: int
        The maximum packet size for our associated endpoint, in bytes.

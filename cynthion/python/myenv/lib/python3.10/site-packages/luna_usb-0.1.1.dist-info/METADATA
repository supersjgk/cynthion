# LUNA: an Amaranth HDL library for USB ![Simulation Status](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/luna/workflows/simulations/badge.svg) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/luna/badge/?version=latest)](https://luna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

LUNA is a toolkit for working with USB using FPGA technology, providing gateware and software to enable USB applications.

Some things you can use LUNA for, currently:

- **Protocol analysis for Low-, Full-, or High- speed USB.** LUNA provides gateware that allow passive USB monitoring when combined with [Cynthion](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/cynthion-hardware) and [Packetry](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/packetry).
- **Creating your own Low-, Full-, High-, or (experimentally) Super- speed USB device.** LUNA provides a collection of Amaranth gateware that allows you to easily create USB devices in gateware, software, or a combination of the two.
- **Building USB functionality into a new or existing System-on-a-Chip (SoC).** LUNA is capable of generating custom peripherals targeting the common Wishbone bus; allowing it to easily be integrated into SoC designs; and the [luna-soc](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/luna-soc) library provides simple automation for developing simple SoC designs.

Some things you'll be able to use LUNA for in the future:

- **Man-in-the-middle'ing USB communications.** The LUNA toolkit will be able to act
  as a *USB proxy*, transparently modifying USB data as it flows between a host and a device.
- **USB reverse engineering and security research.** The LUNA toolkit will serve as an ideal
  backend for tools like [Facedancer](https://github.com/usb-tools/facedancer); allowing easy
  emulation and rapid prototyping of compliant and non-compliant USB devices.

## Project Structure

This project is broken down into several directories:

* `luna` -- the primary LUNA python toolkit; generates gateware and provides USB functionality
  * `luna/gateware` -- the core gateware components for LUNA; and utilities for stitching them together
* `examples` -- simple LUNA-related examples; mostly gateware-targeted, currently
* `docs` -- sources for the LUNA Sphinx documentation
* `contrib` -- contributed/non-core components; such as udev rules
* `applets` -- pre-made gateware applications that provide useful functionality on their own (e.g., are more than examples)

## Project Documentation

LUNA's documentation is captured on [Read the Docs](https://luna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Raw documentation sources
are in the `docs` folder.
